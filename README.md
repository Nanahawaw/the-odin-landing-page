# The Odin Project: Makeup Landing Page

This project is a realization of an assignment provided by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in CSS positioning and Bootstrap framework capabilities.

## Overview

The makeup landing page is themed around the world of beauty and cosmetics. The website encompasses four primary pages:

1. **Home**: An introductory page that welcomes visitors and provides a brief insight into what the website offers.
2. **About Us**: This section elaborates on the essence of the website, its mission, vision, and the team behind it.
3. **Catalog**: A display of various makeup products, collections, and offers.
4. **Contact Us**: A dedicated space for visitors to reach out, make inquiries, and connect.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Built using Bootstrap, the website offers a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern UI**: A clean, intuitive interface designed to engage users and provide easy navigation.
- **Dynamic Positioning**: Demonstrates advanced CSS positioning techniques, ensuring elements are placed and behave as intended across different screen sizes and resolutions.
